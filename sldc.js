// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step. This is where you will gather specific details required for a new system and determine the first ideas for prototypes.  "

const design = "This is the third step. Here you will transform all of the requirements into detailed specifications that cover all aspects of the system. You will also plan and asses security risks in this step. After you have completed the first parts of the design step, you will need to get the approval before it goes into the implementation stage. "

const implementation = "This is the fourth step, and in most developer's opinion, the funest step. This is where the coding and development will take place."

const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step. Here is where it will be tested and pushed to a live environment."

const maintain = "This is the sixth and final step. Here is where you will maintain software that has already been built. Things will break and will need to be repaired, so we maintain it."
